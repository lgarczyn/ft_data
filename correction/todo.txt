todo:
    find way to chck for forbidden functions
    test malloc failure
    update subject for correction
    remove diff thing
    rename bonus options

instructions
	check norme
    check optimisation level
	check allowed functions
		xmalloc
		xfree
        any call to functiosn defined in mem, especially modify_mem_score, is -42
		You can use more, but remember that this is supposed to be used in projects
	check MAGIC numbers
	check main.c after diff
    check valgrind if you want, but the user can defend himself
        basically is he erasing sensitive data or not
    check crash
        if a crash is due to incorrect use, it's ok
        the main is strictly correct used
    prints are allowed under incorrect use
        
    
advice
    check state at start
    use debugger
    init memory to 0
    reimplement realloc
        (can offer some cheap perf if authorized)

mandatory header parts
    prototypes
    t_sortedres/t_sorteden/t_sorteden
    t_pmaen
    t_uint
    t_array
        bzeroed must be valid
        must contain a data element ?
